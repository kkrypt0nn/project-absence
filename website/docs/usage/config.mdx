The config file is the file that is used to configure each module individually. Its **default path** is `~/.absence/config.toml` and has the following **default content**:

```toml title="~/.absence/config.toml"
[domain_takeover]
enabled = true

[subdomains]
enabled_runners = ["dork", "crtsh"]

[subdomains.dork]
search_engine = "google"

[subdomains.crtsh]
ignore_expired = false
recent_only = false
```

Every module can be `enabled` by setting its value to `true` or have at least one runner listed in `enabled_runners` (if the module has runners). Some modules and runners have settings that can be set specifically for them only; see the page of the modules to know what can be set.

Any non-needed module can just be removed from the config file as well.
